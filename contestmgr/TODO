// checker
1. get the solution from a queue
2. build the solution <- can be done in parallel
3. take one built solution 
	3.1 run tests
	3.2 parse results
4. put results into the results queue
// mockgo
1. learn it to read tests from a file

// think about
4. is the best way to built a binary is to call "go built?" or can we
1. templater now is writing convert(mockgo) fhile to a file system
	we neet to store at least solution, test files and built binary at 
	the same place on fs. Do we need to have some object to manage all
	file operations in this directory
2. need to mock the fs. Probably the solution is to use config files
to store paths, and mock the fs using docker eventually
3. UNIT TESTS !!!!
	use some library to call the go tool?
